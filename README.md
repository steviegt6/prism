# prvsm

Prism (stylized **prvsm**) is an experimental Terraria mod that tries to accomplish two tasks:

1. bring OpenGL's GLSL shader language to FNA,
2. and integrate SPIRV-Cross for loading SPIR-V bytecode.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:** This is hacky and works in an atypical manner; this is officially supported by neither FNA nor MojoShader.

## The Name

prvsm is Prism, Prism is prvsm. This is a subtle-but-not-really reference to [PRISM](https://github.com/TerrariaPrismTeam/Prism), which was developed by numerous people including [PoroCYon](https://gitlab.ulyssis.org/pcy), who also [developed the project that this is based on](https://gitlab.ulyssis.org/pcy/fnaglsl).
